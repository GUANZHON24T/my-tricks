## Accounting and Finance

1. **Critically evaluate, discussing arguments in favour and against, the following statements with examples (parts are equally weighted). (18)**

    a)      ‘Financial accounting accurately captures all assets and liabilities of a firm’

    * Accounting normally deals with only those items that are capable of being expressed in monetary terms.

      •Advantage that it is a useful common denominator.

      •However, not all such resources are capable of being measured in monetary terms and so are excluded from a B/S.

      •The money convention, therefore, limits the scope of accounting reports.

      oThe quality of human resources? the intelligence of professor, the ambitons of students...

2. **Critically evaluate, discussing arguments in favour and against, the following statements with examples (all parts are equally weighted).(17)**

   ​         **a)      ‘The best means to expand once a firm has reached a certain size is to have an ==initial public offering==’**



   Answer:

   Shares of a company sold to institutional investors and to the general public for the first time. 

   –a privately held company transforms into a public company.

   shares trade in the open market

   the firm will lose control

   ​         **b)      ‘The ==balance sheet== accurately reports all assets of a firm’** 

   * the purpose of a balance sheet is to set out the financial position of an enterprise at a
     given date, i.e. to report the ASSETS and CLAIMS ofan enterprise.

   * The balance sheet has two counterbalancing sections:

     –the left side lists assets (A), which represent the resources of an enterprise;

     –the right side lists liabilities (L) and owners’ equity (E) which represent claims against those resources.

     •Because the B/S shows the financial status at a particular point in time, the left and right sides are always kept in balance:

     Assets = Liabilities + Owners’ equity. 

   * Accounting normally deals with only those items that are capable of being expressed in monetary terms.

     •Advantage that it is a useful common denominator.

     •However, not all such resources are capable of being measured in monetary terms and so are excluded from a B/S.

     •The money convention, therefore, limits the scope of accounting reports.

     oThe reputation of the products/ company? 

     oThe location of the business?

     oLoyalty of customers?

     * What if it comes from disposing businesses? (e.g. HMV)
   * negative cash flows not aalways bad news

## ?

1. a)   Discuss and critique the following business models(2016): 

    

   ​                                            i.     PEST

   ​                                           ii.     SWOT

   ​                                           iii.     Varieties of Capitalism 

   ​                                           iv.     The Business in Context Model

   *(I think this together with the second part is a bit too much in the time available.  I would leave out SWOT, which I see as essentially a strategy tool anyway)*  

   b)        Discuss how the “Business in Context Model” is relevant to enhance our understanding of HRM?  

   *(I would be inclined to broaden this out and ask.  “Examine how ONE of the above models can aid our understanding of HR policies and practices”.)*
